# PowerBI-Project-Task-3 By Yoshops 
Created beautiful visualization on power bi desktop with the help of charts, graphs, maps and other visuals.
First I have cleaned the data removed duplicate values. Also I removed the values which where not appropriate as per the question I have removed it by filters by Power Query Editor. 
Question 1 
The Shipping Address differs from the Billing Address 
For this question , I represented it by using visuals like Stacked Bar Chart, Clustered Bar Chart, and Cards.

Qestion 2 
Unusally Large Orders (Cut off 50,000)
In this question , I represented it by Clustered Column Chart , Cards and Table so that the sheets are interactive and we can get the information regarding the question.

Question 3
Multiple Orders to same address with different payment methods
In this question, I have used Pie Chart, Tables and Cards .

Question 4 
Unexpected International Orders
For this question, I have used Maps , Tables , Cards So that the information you can get in sheet as well.
